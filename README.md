# BillsBuster

BillsBuster is a mobile responsive app that allows users to keep track of their total monthly amount of money spent on bills, while comparing it alongside their income.

### Dependencies

Users will need to install the following NPM packages:

* Axios
* Body-Parser
* Express
* MySQL
* Sequelize
* Sequelize-Cli
* Nodemon
* Yarn
* React

### Usage

After registering with a **username/email** and password, users can add how much of their money they are spending on bills each month by adding them all together. Users will have the ability to calculate the sum of one-time and recurring monthly costs, which is then compared to their monthly income. BillsBuster is designed to make managing your finances simpler and more comprehensive.

### Technologies

BillsBuster uses GET and POST routes to handle its data, along with a MySQL database using a Sequelize ORM. The app display is designed with Ionic and Bootstrap frameworks.
